      "أ‌. رمي حجارة على محيط القطعة وفي هذه الحالة لو كان هنا أي لغم أو شرك فإنه سينفجر . \n",
      "ب‌. عند التقدم من القطعة نراعي أن نضع القدم في الأماكن التي وقعت فيها الحجرة التي رميناها وذلك لأن المكان يكون مضمون من عدم وجود ألغام . \n",
      "ت‌. عدم رفع قطعة السلاح أو تحريكها باليد وإنما إحضار خطاف مع حبل وشبك الخطاف بواقي الزناد والابتعاد عن قطعة السلاح والاختباء وراء ساتر ومن ثم سحب السلاح بواسطة الحبل وتحريك السلاح من أجل التأكد من أن السلاح غير مفخخ عن طريق السحب .\n",
      "بعد التأكد من أن السلاح غير مفخخ نأخذ السلاح ويجب اتباع التعليمات التالية عند فكه :-\n",
      "1. يجب الحذر من فك المخزن لأنه يمكن أن يكون مفخخ وينفجر عن طريق فك المخزن لذلك يجب ربط المخزن بحبل أو خيط بلاستيك قوي وتثبيت السلاح ومن ثم ضغط مسمار فك السلاح بواسطة سيخ طويل في حال كان السلاح إم 16 أو ما يشبهه في طريقة فك المخزن  أو فتح عتلة فك المخزن ووضع عود صغير كي تبقى مرفوعة ويبقى المخزن محرراً ، في حال كان السلاح كلاشنكوف أو ما يشبهه في طريقة فك المخزن ومن ثم الابتعاد وسحب المخزن من السلاح بواسطة الخيط المربوط فيه وذلك من خلف ساتر . حتى تتأكد من انفصال المخزن عن السلاح . \n",

      "فحص القنابل :-\n",
      "من الناحية الأمنية :\n",
      "في حال الحصول على القنابل من مصادر مشبوهة فيمكن أن تكون مفخخة وهناك ثلاث احتمالات التفخيخ القنبلة :\n",
      "أ‌. فإما يكون التفخيخ عند بحيث تنفجر القنبلة عند تركيب المشعل .\n",
      "ب‌. وإما عند سحب مسار الأمان .\n",
      "ت‌. وإما عند إفلات العتلة لرميها .\n",
      "لفحص الحالة الأولى يجب اتباع الخطوات التالية :-\n",
      "1. في حال استلام القنابل مفصولة عن المشاعل يجب قياس عمق وقطر الثقب المخصص لدخول الصاعق والتأكد من أنه مناسب لطول وسماكة الصاعق وأن الصاعق يدخل بسهولة ، لأنه قد يوضع في من الأسفل مسار أو برغي بحث يعمل على حصر الصاعق وبالتالي عند تركيبة ومحاولة تثبيته  في مكانه فإنه يبدأ يحتك بالجدار في حال كان القطر ضيق أو ينضغط في حال وضع مسار أسفله وبالتالي ينفجر الصاعق أثناء تركيبه ويمكن الأستفادة من أي عود أو قلم حبر أو رصاص بشرط أن يكون بسماكة الصاعق ، ويتم ادخال القلم  في فتحة القنبلة وقياس العمق ومقارنته بطول الصاعق .\n",
      "2. عند تثبيت الصاعق يجب أن يكون اللف بالصاعق يبقى جسم القنبلة ثابت وذلك لأن الصاعق خفيف وبالتالي نشعر بأي استعصاء يحدث أثناء لفة أما في حال كان اللف بواسطة جسم القنبلة فإننا لا نشعر بوجود استعصاء .\n",
      "لفحص الحالة الثانية من التفخيخ يتم فحص مشعل القنبلة لوحده دون القنبلة حتى لا نخسرها في حال كان مفخخاً :-\n",
      "1. الطريقة الأولى وهي بالغط على عتلة القنبلة فإذا كنت تشعر بوجود مقاومة في العتلة لضغطك عليها  فهذا يعني أنها سليمة ، أما إذا شعرت أنه لا يوج مقاومة فيعني هذا أنها غير ممسكة بالإبرة أو الطارق الذي سيضرب الكبسولة. لأن اعتماد عملية التفخيخ  تكون على فصل عتلة القنبلة عن الإبرة أو الطارق الذي يضرب الكبسولة بحيث يكون مسمار الأمان هو المثبت لهذا الطارق أو الإبرة وفي حال سحبة فإنه ينفلت وتنفجر القنبلة ( الطارق أو الإبرة بالوضع الطبيعي يكون مضغوط بواسطة نابض ومثبت بالعتلة والعتلة مثبتة بواسطة مسمار الأمان ).\n",
      "2. نثبت عتلة القنبلة مع جسم المشعل بواسطة لاصق ونثبت المشعل في جذع شجرة أو شيء يمكن تثبيتها علية شرط أن لا يكون قابل للانفجار أو الاشتعال .\n",

      "4. نقوم بتسليك مسمار الأمان لتسهيل عملية انزلاقه عند سحبه .\n",
      "5. الابتعاد عن المشعل وسحب مسمار الأمان من خلف ساتر . \n",
      "6. بعد التأكد من أن المشعل غير مفخخ نعيد وضع مسار الأمان في مكانه ونثبته كما كان ونفك المشعل .\n",
      "أما في الحالة الثالثة حيث يكون التفخيخ بنزع الفتيل البطيء حيث تنفجر القنبلة فور رمايتها أي في الهواء مما يؤدي إلى مقتل الرامي وفي هذه يجب التأكد من وجود الفتيل البطيء ويمكن معرفة إذا كانت مفخخة أم لا من خلال التالي :- \n",
      "1. تفحص الصاعق وملاحظة إذا كان قد غير أو أنه يختلف عن الصاعق المتعارف عليه للقنابل .\n",
      "2. فك الصاعق والتأكد من وجود الفتيل البطيء وهذه تحتاج إلى خبرة جيدة لذلك لا ينصح بأن يقوم بذلك غير الخبير . \n",
      "3.  في حال كان هناك مجموعة قنابل يجب تجريب واحدة وتكون التجربة على المشعل بدون القنبلة وذلك بتثبته في مكان وإبقاء العتلة حرة الحركة ، وتجليس رأس مسمار الأمان وربطة بخيط والابتعاد عنه وسحب مسمار الأمان بواسطة الخيط من خلف ساتر وعند سحبة فإن العتلة ستنفلت لوحدها . فإذا انفجر المشعل مباشرة فيعني هذا أنه مفخخ أم إذا مضى وقت من 3.5 ـ 6 ثواني فيعني أنه سليم وغير مفخخ . \n",
      "الناحية الفنية :\n",
      "عند استلام القنابل يجب التأكد من نوع القنبلة على أنها قنبلة انفجارية وليست كيميائية ( حارقة ، غازية ، دخانية ) والتأكد من نوعها هجومية / دفاعية والتأكد من صلاحيتها وذلك بالطرق التالية :-\n",
      "1. في حال كانت القنبلة مجهزة بالمشعل يجب فكها والتأكد من وجود الصاعق في المشعل ووجود المادة المتفجرة داخل القنبلة . \n",
      "2.  يجب التأكد من أن المشاعل تركب في القنابل وتثبت فيها في حال استلام المشاعل مفصولة عن القنابل .\n",
      "3. يجب الانتباه إلى الصاعق أن لا يكون عليه بقع بيضاء  في حال كان من الألمنيوم أو بقع خضراء في حال كان من مادة النحاس أو وجود أثر لضربات أو اهتراء فيه .\n",
      "4. في حال كان غلاف القنبلة من المعدن السميك المضلع فإنها تكون قنبلة دفاعية وهناك بعض القنابل يكون الغلاف من البلاستيك وهذه إذا كانت دفاعية فأن الغلاف البلاستيكي بكون مضلع أيضاً وتكون تحوي بالداخل بيل تكون بمثابة الشظايا . أما في حالكان الغلاف من المعدن الرقيق أو البلاستيك الأملس فإن القنبلة تكون هجومية .\n",
      "5. يجب الانتباه إلى مدة الزمن التأخيري للقنبلة وغالباً ما تكون القنابل من ( 3.5 ـ 6 ثواني ) \n",
      "6. الانتباه إلى القنابل الصدمية لأنه ليس لها زمن تأخيري .\n",
      "فحص الفتائل :-\n",
      "نحتاج لفحص الفتيل كي نتأكد من نوعه ( اشتعالي ، انفجاري ) ومن أنه صالح وغير مستهلك وكي نتأكد أيضاً من سرعته أهو بطيء أم سريع في حال كان الفتيل  اشتعالي وذلك بالخطوات التالية :-\n",
      "لمعرفة الفتيل الاشتعالي من الفتيل الانفجاري يتم ذلك عن طريق :-\n",
      "1. في حال محاولة إشعال الفتيل الانفجاري فإنه يسيح الغلاف  ولا يشتعل  الفتيل.\n",
      "2. رؤية المواد الداخلية للفتيل فالفتيل الانفجاري لون المادة الداخلية بيضاء وهي مادة متفجرة نصف حساسة  على شكل بودرة وعند تفريغها من الفتيل وإشعالها تشتعل وتعطي لهب كلهب الغاز وبدن دخان .\n",
      "3. أما الفتيل الاشتعالي فإن المادة المكونة له هي مادة البارود ولونها أسود يميل إلى الرمادي ( فيراني ) . \n",
      "4. عند إشعال الفتيل أو إشعال المادة الموجدة داخله  تشتعل كالبارود وتعطي دخان .\n",
      "كيفية فحص الفتيل البطيء :-\n",
      "1.  قطع مسافة 20سم من الفتيل ورميها لأنه لا يمكن الاعتماد عليها في الفحص لأنها قد تكون تعرضت لرطوبة وأول ما يرطب بالفتيل هي الأطراف. \n",
      "2.  قطع مسافة 15سم من نفس الفتيل و من الطرف الذي قطعنا منه وإشعالها .\n",
      "3.  حساب الوقت الذي تستغرقه القطعة لتصل الشعلة إلى نهايتها .\n",
      "4.  في حال كان الفتيل بطيء فإنه يحتاج إلى حوالي 15 ثانية قد يزيد قليلاً أو ينقص قليلاً .\n",
      "ملاحظة : -\n",
      "1. في حال أن الفتيل اشتعل بسرعة وخلال ثانية هذا يعني أنه سريع ولايصلح للاستخدام العسكري ( فقط يستخدم للخداع و التفخيخ ) .\n",
      "2. في حال أن الفتيل كان اشتعاله بطيء جداً أو أنه لم يشتعل أو أنه ينطفئ بعد إشعاله أو أن في تقطيع أثناء الاشتعال فهذا يعني أنه تعرض لرطوبة .\n",
      "3. يجب تفحص الفتيل يجب أن يكون خالي من الضربات والثنيات الحادة ( التي تسبب انفصال مادة البارود عن بعضها .\n",
      "فحص الصواعق :-\n",
      "الفحص من التفخيخ :-\n",
      "وهذا يكون في حال أن وصلت الصواعق من مصادر مشبوهة وكانت أطراف أسلاك الصاعق مفصولة عن بعض . ولكي نتفادى أي خلل يجب أتباع الخطوات التالية :-\n",
      "1.  لا تلامس  أطراف الأسلاك لبعضها وأنت قريب منها .\n",
      "2.  ضع الصاعق في منطقة مناسبة بعيد عن باقي الصواعق وعن المتفجرات وعن أي مواد قابلة للاشتعال .\n",
      "3. اختبئ خلف ساتر ومن ثم لامس أطراف الصاعق .\n",
      "4. في حال لم ينفجر ثبت الأطراف مع بعضها ولفها بلاصق عازل .\n",
      "ملاحظة : في حال كان المكان حساس و تريد أن لا يُسمع  صوت الصاعق في حال كان مفخخ وانفجر ، فيجب إحضار تنكة 20 لتر فارغة وملئها بالرمل ودفن الصاعق في وسطها بشرط أن يكون عقب الصاعق باتجاه الأسفل ويمن رش قليل من الماء على الرمل حتى يعمل أيضاً على امتصاص الصوت ، في هذه الحالة يكون الصوت ضعيف جداً في حال انفجار الصاعق .\n",
      "فحص الصواعق من الناحية الفنية :-\n",
      "1. تفحص جسم الصاعق فيجب أن يكون خالي من أي أثر للرطوبة وتكون  الرطوبة إما اهتراء أو على  شكل بقع بيضاء في صواعق الألمنيوم أو  شكل بقع خضراء في الصواعق النحاسية .\n",
      "2. التأكد من عدم تعرض الصاعق لضربات أو صدمات .\n",
      "3. في حال كان الصاعق كهربائي  التأكد من أن سلك التنغستن يعمل وذلك بفحصه بواسطة مقياس الأوم .\n",
      "4. التأكد من زمن الصاعق .\n",

      "* كلما كان لون الـ تي ان تي مائل إلى اللون الابيض كلما كان أنقى وجديد . \n",
      "* كلما كان لون الـ تي ان تي مائل إلى اللون البني كلما كان قديم وأقل نقاء . \n",
      "* كلما كان قالب الـ تي ان تي متماسك كلما كان جديد وجيد . \n",
      "* إذا كان قالب الـ تي ان تي يتفتت بسهول ويتكسر كلما كان قديم وتعرض للرطوبة .\n",
      "بالنسبة لمادة الـ تي ان تي نأخذ قطعة صغيرة ونشعلها ، وعند اشتعالها تعطي دخان أسود وتبدأ تسيح المادة مثل البلاستيك وبعد اشتعالها بالكامل يتبقى أثر يشبه مادة الزفتة . \n",
      "ثانياً : الـ سي 4 .\n",
      "* كلما كانت مادة السي 4 طرية وسهلة التعجين أي تشبه العلكة كلما كانت جيدة . \n",
      "* إذا كانت صلبة نوعاً ما وتتفتت عند تعجينها تكون أقل جودة وقديمة . \n",
      "* مادة السي 4 الأصلية تأتي قوالب مغلفة بنايلون أخضر عسكرة . أما التي تأتي مغلفة بنايلون شفاف فهي تقليد ولكن لا بأس بها . \n",
      "بالنسبة لمادة السي 4 عند اشعالها تشتعل وتعطي لهب صافي ويكون اشتعالها كاشتعال الغاز ولا يلحظ تصاعد الدخان منها ولا وبعد اشتعالها بالكامل لا يكاد يبقى منها شيء .\n",

      "\n",
      "brittle  in  low  temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Whenever possible, antenna cables should be constructed\n",
      "overhead to prevent damage from heavy snow and frost. Nylon rope\n",
      "guidelines, if available, should be used in preference to cotton or hemp\n",
      "because nylon ropes do not readily absorb moisture and are less likely to\n",
      "freeze and break.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) An antenna should have extra guidelines, supports, and anchor\n",
      "\n",
      "stakes to strengthen it to withstand heavy ice and wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Some radios (usually older generation radios) adjusted to a\n",
      "specific frequency in a relatively warm place may drift off frequency when\n",
      "exposed to extreme cold. Low battery voltage can also cause frequency drift.\n",
      "When possible, a radio should warmup several minutes before placing it\n",
      "into operation. Since extreme cold tends to lower output voltage of a dry\n",
      "battery, warming the battery with body heat before operating the radio set\n",
      "can reduce frequency drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Flakes or pellets of highly electrically charged snow is sometimes\n",
      "experienced in northern regions. When these particles strike the\n",
      "antenna, the resulting electrical discharge causes a high-pitched static\n",
      "roar that can blanket all frequencies. To overcome this static, antenna\n",
      "elements can be covered with polystyrene tape and shellac.\n",

      "degree of exposure to cold temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Winterization. The radio set technical manual should rechecked for\n",
      "special precautions for operation in extremely cold climates. For example,\n",
      "normal lubricants may solidify and cause damage or malfunctions.\n",
      "They must be replaced with the recommended Arctic lubricants.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Microphone.  Moisture from the sniper’s breath may freeze on the\n",
      "perforated cover plate of his microphone. Standard microphone covers\n",
      "can be used to prevent this. If standard covers are not available, a suitable\n",
      "cover can be improvised from rubber or cellophane membranes or from\n",
      "rayon or nylon cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Breathing and sweating. A radio set generates heat when it\n",
      "is operated. When turned off, the air inside the radio set cools and\n",
      "contracts, and draws cold air into the set from the outside. This is\n",
      "called breathing. When a radio breathes and the still-hot parts come in\n",
      "contact with subzero air, the glass, plastic, and ceramic parts of the set may\n",
      "cool too rapidly and break. When cold equipment is brought suddenly\n",
      "into contact with warm air, moisture condenses on the equipment parts.\n",
      "This is called sweating. Before cold equipment is brought into a heated\n",
      "area, it should be wrapped in a blanket or parka to ensure that it warms\n",
      "gradually to reduce sweating. Equipment must be thoroughly dry before\n",
      "it is taken into the cold air or the moisture will freeze.\n",

      "(a) Use the quick-reference table (Table 7-2, page 7-19) to determine\n",
      "the length of the elements (one radiating and three ground planes) for the\n",
      "frequency that will be used. Cut these elements (A, Figure 7-13,\n",

      "(B, Figure 7-13) the same length. Place the ends of the sticks together to\n",
      "form a triangle and tie the ends with wire, tape, or rope. Attach an\n",
      "insulator to each corner. Attach a ground-plane wire to each insulator.\n",
      "Bring the other ends of the ground-plane wires together, attach them to\n",
      "an insulator (C, Figure 7-13, page 7-18), and tie securely. Strip about\n",

      "Strip about 3 inches of insulation from the radiating element at\n",
      "insulator C.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Cut enough WD-1 field wire to reach from the proposed location\n",
      "of the antenna to the radio set. Keep this line as short as possible, because\n",
      "excess length reduces the efficiency of the system. Tie a knot at each end\n",
      "to identify it as the “hot” lead. Remove insulation from the “hot” wire\n",
      "and tie it to the radiating element wire at insulator C. Remove insulation\n",
      "from the other wire and attach it to the bare ground-plane element wires\n",
      "at insulator C. Tape all connections and do not allow the radiating\n",
      "element wire to touch the ground-plane wires.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) Attach a rope to the insulator on the free end of the radiating\n",
      "element and toss the rope over the branches of a tree. Pull the antenna\n",

      "lead and about 3 inches of insulation from the other wire. Attach the\n",
      "“hot” line to the antenna terminal (doublet connector, if so labeled).\n",
      "Attach the other wire to the metal case-the handle, for example. Be sure\n",

      "meters (6 feet) at right angles (plus or minus 30 degrees) to the\n",
      "antenna section before dropping to the radio set. The easiest way to\n",
      "set up this antenna is to measure the length of the radiating elements\n",
      "from one end of the lead-in (WD-1) and tie a knot at that point. The\n",

      "7-10. DESERT AREAS\n",
      "Radio is usually the primary means of communications in the desert. It can\n",
      "be employed effectively in desert climate and terrain to provide a highly\n",
      "mobile means of communications demanded by widely dispersed forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Techniques for Better Operations. For the best operation in the\n",
      "desert, radio antennas should be located on the highest terrain available.\n",
      "In the desert, transmitters using whip antennas lose one-fifth to one-third\n",
      "of their normal range due to the poor electrical grounding common to desert\n",
      "terrain. For this reason, complete antenna systems must be used such as\n",
      "horizontal dipoles and vertical antennas with adequate counterpoises.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Equipment Considerations.  Some radios automatically switch on\n",
      "their second blower fan if their internal temperature rises too high.\n",
      "Normally, this happens only in temperate climates when the radios\n",
      "are transmitting. This may disturb soldiers unaccustomed to radio\n",
      "operation in the desert environment. Operation of the second fan,\n",
      "however, is quite normal. Radio frequency power amplifiers used in AM\n",
      "and single sideband sets may overheat and burn out. Such equipment\n",
      "should be turned on only when necessary (signal reception is not affected).\n",
      "Since the RF power amplifiers take about 90 seconds to reach the\n",
      "operating mode, the SOP of units using the equipment allows for delays\n",
      "in  replying.  Dust  affects  communications  equipment  such  as  SSB/AMRF\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "FM 23-10\n",
      "\n",
      "power  amplifiers  and  radio  teletypewriter  sets.  Radio  teletypewriter  sets\n",
      "are prone to damage due to the vulnerability of the oil lubrication system,\n",
      "which attracts and holds dust particles. Dust covers, therefore, should be\n",
      "used when possible. Some receiver-transmitter units have ventilating\n",
      "ports and channels that can get clogged with dust. These must be checked\n",
      "regularly and kept clean to prevent overheating.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "weather causes batteries to fail more rapidly.\n",

      "d. Electrical Insulation. Wind-blown sand and grit damage\n",
      "electrical wire insulation over time. All cables that are likely to be\n",
      "damaged should be protected with tape before insulation becomes worn.\n",
      "Sand also finds its way into parts of items, such as “spaghetti cord” plugs,\n",
      "either preventing electrical contact or making it impossible to join the\n",
      "plugs together. A brush, such as an old toothbrush, should be carried and\n",
      "used to clean such items before they are joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "e. Condensation. In deserts with relatively high dew levels and high\n",
      "humidity, overnight condensation can occur wherever surfaces are cooler\n",
      "than the air temperature, such as metals exposed to air. This condensation\n",
      "can affect electrical plugs, jacks, and connectors. All connectors likely to\n",
      "be affected by condensation should be taped to prevent moisture from\n",
      "contaminating the contacts. Plugs should be dried before inserting them\n",
      "into equipment jacks. Excessive moisture or dew should be dried from\n",
      "antenna connectors to prevent arcing.\n",
      "\n",
      "f. Static Electricity. Static electricity is prevalent in the desert. It is\n",
      "caused by many factors, one of which is wind-blown dust particles.\n",
      "Extremely low humidity contributes to static discharges between charged\n",
      "particles. Poor grounding conditions aggravate the problem. All sharp\n",
      "edges (tips) of antennas should be taped to reduce wind-caused static\n",
      "discharges and the accompanying noise. If operating from a fixed\n",
      "position, teams ensure that equipment is properly grounded.\n",
      "Since static-caused noise lessens with an increase infrequency, the highest\n",
      "frequencies that are available and authorized should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "g. Maintenance Improvement. In desert areas, the maintenance of\n",
      "radio sets becomes more difficult due to the large amounts of sand, dust, or\n",
      "dirt that enter the equipment. Sets equipped with servomechanisms are\n",
      "especially affected. To reduce maintenance downtime, the team must keep\n",
      "sets in dustproof containers as much as possible. Air vent filters should also\n",
      "be kept clean to allow cool air to circulate to prevent overheating. Preventive\n",
      "maintenance checks should be made often. Also, the team should closely\n",

      "\n",
      "a. Very high frequency radios are not as effective in urbanized terrain\n",
      "as they are in other areas. The power output and operating frequencies\n",

      "street level is not always possible in built-up areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. High frequency radios do not require or rely on line of sight as\n",
      "much as VHF radios. This is due to operating frequencies being lower\n",
      "and power output being greater. The problem is that HF radio sets are\n",
      "not organic to small units. To overcome this, the VHF signals must\n",
      "be retransmitted.\n",

      "c. Retransmission stations in aerial platforms can provide the most\n",
      "effective means if available. Organic retransmission is more likely to\n",
      "be used. The antenna should be hidden or blended in with surroundings.\n",
      "This helps prevent the enemy from using it as a landmark to “home in”\n",

      "an antenna when transmission is dangerous or forbidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) In some radio sets, the sniper uses the transmitter to adjust\n",
      "the antenna. First, he sets the controls of the transmitter to normal; then,\n",
      "he tunes the system by adjusting the antenna height, the antenna length,\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) Antenna cables must be handled carefully since they become\n",
      "\n",
      "brittle  in  low  temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Whenever possible, antenna cables should be constructed\n",
      "overhead to prevent damage from heavy snow and frost. Nylon rope\n",
      "guidelines, if available, should be used in preference to cotton or hemp\n",
      "because nylon ropes do not readily absorb moisture and are less likely to\n",
      "freeze and break.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) An antenna should have extra guidelines, supports, and anchor\n",
      "\n",
      "stakes to strengthen it to withstand heavy ice and wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Some radios (usually older generation radios) adjusted to a\n",
      "specific frequency in a relatively warm place may drift off frequency when\n",
      "exposed to extreme cold. Low battery voltage can also cause frequency drift.\n",
      "When possible, a radio should warmup several minutes before placing it\n",
      "into operation. Since extreme cold tends to lower output voltage of a dry\n",
      "battery, warming the battery with body heat before operating the radio set\n",
      "can reduce frequency drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Flakes or pellets of highly electrically charged snow is sometimes\n",
      "experienced in northern regions. When these particles strike the\n",
      "antenna, the resulting electrical discharge causes a high-pitched static\n",
      "roar that can blanket all frequencies. To overcome this static, antenna\n",
      "elements can be covered with polystyrene tape and shellac.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Maintenance Improvement in Arctic Areas. The maintenance of\n",
      "radio equipment in extreme cold presents many problems. Radio sets\n",
      "must be protected from blowing snow since snow will freeze to dials and\n",
      "knobs and blow into the wiring to cause shorts and grounds. Cords must\n",
      "be handled carefully as they may lose their flexibility in extreme cold.\n",
      "All radio equipment must be properly winterized. The appropriate\n",
      "technical manual should be checked for winterization procedures.\n",
      "Some suggestions for maintenance in Arctic areas include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Batteries. The effect of cold weather conditions on wet and dry\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "FM 23-10\n",
      "\n",
      "battery, the load on the battery, the specific use of the battery, and the\n",
      "degree of exposure to cold temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Winterization. The radio set technical manual should rechecked for\n",
      "special precautions for operation in extremely cold climates. For example,\n",
      "normal lubricants may solidify and cause damage or malfunctions.\n",
      "They must be replaced with the recommended Arctic lubricants.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Microphone.  Moisture from the sniper’s breath may freeze on the\n",
      "perforated cover plate of his microphone. Standard microphone covers\n",
      "can be used to prevent this. If standard covers are not available, a suitable\n",
      "cover can be improvised from rubber or cellophane membranes or from\n",
      "rayon or nylon cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Breathing and sweating. A radio set generates heat when it\n",
      "is operated. When turned off, the air inside the radio set cools and\n",
      "contracts, and draws cold air into the set from the outside. This is\n",
      "called breathing. When a radio breathes and the still-hot parts come in\n",
      "contact with subzero air, the glass, plastic, and ceramic parts of the set may\n",
      "cool too rapidly and break. When cold equipment is brought suddenly\n",
      "into contact with warm air, moisture condenses on the equipment parts.\n",
      "This is called sweating. Before cold equipment is brought into a heated\n",
      "area, it should be wrapped in a blanket or parka to ensure that it warms\n",
      "gradually to reduce sweating. Equipment must be thoroughly dry before\n",
      "it is taken into the cold air or the moisture will freeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "7-9. JUNGLE AREAS\n",

      "The mobility and various configurations in which a single-channel radio\n",
      "can be deployed are its main advantages in jungle areas. Limitations on\n",
      "radio communications in jungle areas are due to the climate and the\n",
      "density of jungle growth. The hot and humid climate increases\n",
      "maintenance problems of keeping the equipment operable. Thick jungle\n",
      "growth acts as a vertically polarized absorbing screen for radio frequency\n",
      "energy that, in effect, reduces transmission range. Therefore, increased\n",

      "effects of moisture, fungus, and insects. This also applies to all power and\n",
      "telephone cables.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Use complete antenna systems, such as ground planes and\n",
      "\n",
      "dipoles, for more effect than fractional wavelength whip antennas.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Clear vegetation from antenna sites. If an antenna touches any\n",
      "\n",
      "foliage, especially wet foliage, the signal will be grounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) When wet, vegetation acts like a vertically polarized screen and\n",

      "antennas in preference to vertically polarized antennas.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Maintenance Improvement in the Jungle. Due to moisture and\n",
      "fungus, the maintenance of radio sets in tropical climates is more difficult\n",

      "to form on the equipment and encourages the growth of fungus.\n",
      "Operators and maintenance personnel should check appropriate technical\n",
      "manuals for special maintenance requirements. Some techniques for\n",
      "improving maintenance in jungle areas follow:\n",

      "\n",
      "growth as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Clear all air vents of obstructions so air can circulate to cool and\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Keep connectors, cables, and bare metal parts as free of fungus\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Use moisture and fungus-proofing paint to protect equipment\n",

      "\n",
      "(a) Use the quick-reference table (Table 7-2, page 7-19) to determine\n",
      "the length of the elements (one radiating and three ground planes) for the\n",
      "frequency that will be used. Cut these elements (A, Figure 7-13,\n",
      "page 7-18) from WD-1 field wire (or similar wire). Cut spacing sticks\n",
      "(B, Figure 7-13) the same length. Place the ends of the sticks together to\n",
      "form a triangle and tie the ends with wire, tape, or rope. Attach an\n",
      "insulator to each corner. Attach a ground-plane wire to each insulator.\n",
      "Bring the other ends of the ground-plane wires together, attach them to\n",
      "an insulator (C, Figure 7-13, page 7-18), and tie securely. Strip about\n",
      "3 inches of insulation from each wire and twist them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Tie one end of the radiating element wire to the other side of\n",

      "Strip about 3 inches of insulation from the radiating element at\n",
      "insulator C.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Cut enough WD-1 field wire to reach from the proposed location\n",
      "of the antenna to the radio set. Keep this line as short as possible, because\n",
      "excess length reduces the efficiency of the system. Tie a knot at each end\n",
      "to identify it as the “hot” lead. Remove insulation from the “hot” wire\n",
      "and tie it to the radiating element wire at insulator C. Remove insulation\n",
      "from the other wire and attach it to the bare ground-plane element wires\n",
      "at insulator C. Tape all connections and do not allow the radiating\n",
      "element wire to touch the ground-plane wires.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) Attach a rope to the insulator on the free end of the radiating\n",
      "element and toss the rope over the branches of a tree. Pull the antenna\n",
      "as high as possible, keeping the lead-in routed down through the triangle.\n",

      "(e) At the radio set, remove about 1 inch of insulation from the “hot”\n",
      "lead and about 3 inches of insulation from the other wire. Attach the\n",
      "“hot” line to the antenna terminal (doublet connector, if so labeled).\n",
      "Attach the other wire to the metal case-the handle, for example. Be sure\n",
      "both connections are tight or secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "(f) Set up correct frequency, turn on the set, and proceed with\n",

      "wires are cut to the length shown in Table 7-2 for the operating\n",

      "meters (6 feet) at right angles (plus or minus 30 degrees) to the\n",
      "antenna section before dropping to the radio set. The easiest way to\n",
      "set up this antenna is to measure the length of the radiating elements\n",
      "from one end of the lead-in (WD-1) and tie a knot at that point. The\n",

      "7-10. DESERT AREAS\n",
      "Radio is usually the primary means of communications in the desert. It can\n",
      "be employed effectively in desert climate and terrain to provide a highly\n",
      "mobile means of communications demanded by widely dispersed forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Techniques for Better Operations. For the best operation in the\n",
      "desert, radio antennas should be located on the highest terrain available.\n",
      "In the desert, transmitters using whip antennas lose one-fifth to one-third\n",
      "of their normal range due to the poor electrical grounding common to desert\n",
      "terrain. For this reason, complete antenna systems must be used such as\n",
      "horizontal dipoles and vertical antennas with adequate counterpoises.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Equipment Considerations.  Some radios automatically switch on\n",
      "their second blower fan if their internal temperature rises too high.\n",
      "Normally, this happens only in temperate climates when the radios\n",
      "are transmitting. This may disturb soldiers unaccustomed to radio\n",
      "operation in the desert environment. Operation of the second fan,\n",
      "however, is quite normal. Radio frequency power amplifiers used in AM\n",
      "and single sideband sets may overheat and burn out. Such equipment\n",
      "should be turned on only when necessary (signal reception is not affected).\n",
      "Since the RF power amplifiers take about 90 seconds to reach the\n",
      "operating mode, the SOP of units using the equipment allows for delays\n",
      "in  replying.  Dust  affects  communications  equipment  such  as  SSB/AMRF\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "FM 23-10\n",
      "\n",
      "power  amplifiers  and  radio  teletypewriter  sets.  Radio  teletypewriter  sets\n",
      "are prone to damage due to the vulnerability of the oil lubrication system,\n",
      "which attracts and holds dust particles. Dust covers, therefore, should be\n",
      "used when possible. Some receiver-transmitter units have ventilating\n",
      "ports and channels that can get clogged with dust. These must be checked\n",
      "regularly and kept clean to prevent overheating.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Batteries. Dry battery supplies must be increased, since hot\n",
      "\n",
      "weather causes batteries to fail more rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "d. Electrical Insulation. Wind-blown sand and grit damage\n",
      "electrical wire insulation over time. All cables that are likely to be\n",
      "damaged should be protected with tape before insulation becomes worn.\n",
      "Sand also finds its way into parts of items, such as “spaghetti cord” plugs,\n",
      "either preventing electrical contact or making it impossible to join the\n",
      "plugs together. A brush, such as an old toothbrush, should be carried and\n",
      "used to clean such items before they are joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "e. Condensation. In deserts with relatively high dew levels and high\n",
      "humidity, overnight condensation can occur wherever surfaces are cooler\n",
      "than the air temperature, such as metals exposed to air. This condensation\n",
      "can affect electrical plugs, jacks, and connectors. All connectors likely to\n",
      "be affected by condensation should be taped to prevent moisture from\n",
      "contaminating the contacts. Plugs should be dried before inserting them\n",
      "into equipment jacks. Excessive moisture or dew should be dried from\n",
      "antenna connectors to prevent arcing.\n",
      "\n",
      "f. Static Electricity. Static electricity is prevalent in the desert. It is\n",
      "caused by many factors, one of which is wind-blown dust particles.\n",
      "Extremely low humidity contributes to static discharges between charged\n",
      "particles. Poor grounding conditions aggravate the problem. All sharp\n",
      "edges (tips) of antennas should be taped to reduce wind-caused static\n",
      "discharges and the accompanying noise. If operating from a fixed\n",
      "position, teams ensure that equipment is properly grounded.\n",
      "Since static-caused noise lessens with an increase infrequency, the highest\n",
      "frequencies that are available and authorized should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "g. Maintenance Improvement. In desert areas, the maintenance of\n",
      "radio sets becomes more difficult due to the large amounts of sand, dust, or\n",
      "dirt that enter the equipment. Sets equipped with servomechanisms are\n",
      "especially affected. To reduce maintenance downtime, the team must keep\n",
      "sets in dustproof containers as much as possible. Air vent filters should also\n",
      "be kept clean to allow cool air to circulate to prevent overheating. Preventive\n",
      "maintenance checks should be made often. Also, the team should closely\n",

      "\n",
      "a. Very high frequency radios are not as effective in urbanized terrain\n",
      "as they are in other areas. The power output and operating frequencies\n",

      "street level is not always possible in built-up areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. High frequency radios do not require or rely on line of sight as\n",
      "much as VHF radios. This is due to operating frequencies being lower\n",
      "and power output being greater. The problem is that HF radio sets are\n",
      "not organic to small units. To overcome this, the VHF signals must\n",
      "be retransmitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Retransmission stations in aerial platforms can provide the most\n",
      "effective means if available. Organic retransmission is more likely to\n",
      "be used. The antenna should be hidden or blended in with surroundings.\n",
      "This helps prevent the enemy from using it as a landmark to “home in”\n",

      "wire is added that is nearly the same length as the missing part of the whip.\n",
      "The pole support is then lashed securely to both sections of the antenna.\n",
      "The two antenna sections are cleaned thoroughly to ensure good contact\n",
      "before connecting them to the pole support. If possible, the connections\n",
      "are  soldered.\n",

      "b. Wire Antennas. Emergency repair of a wire antenna may involve\n",
      "the repair or replacement of the wire used as the antenna or transmission\n",
      "line; or the repair or replacement of the assembly used to support\n",
      "the antenna.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) When one or more wires of an antenna are broken, the antenna\n",
      "can be repaired by reconnecting the broken wires. To do this, lower the\n",
      "antenna to the ground, clean the ends of the wires, and twist the\n",
      "wires together. Whenever possible, solder the connection.\n",

      "\n",
      "antenna should be the same length as the antenna it replaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Antennas supported by trees can usually survive heavy wind\n",
      "storms if the trunk of a tree or a strong branch is used as a support.\n",
      "To keep the antenna taut and to prevent it from breaking or stretching as\n",
      "the trees sway, the sniper attaches a spring or old inner tube to one end\n",
      "of the antenna. Another technique is to pass a rope through a pulley\n",
      "or eyehook. The rope is attached to the end of the antenna and loaded\n",
      "with a heavyweight to keep the antenna tightly drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Guidelines used to hold antenna supports are made of rope\n",
      "or wire. To ensure the guidelines will not affect the operation of the\n",

      "the pieces with insulators.\n",

      "b. Adjustment. An improvised antenna may change the performance\n",
      "of a radio set. The following methods can be used to determine if the\n",
      "antenna is operating properly\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) A distant station may be used to test the antenna. If the signal\n",
      "received from this station is strong, the antenna is operating satisfactorily.\n",
      "If the signal is weak, the sniper adjusts the height and length of the antenna\n",
      "and the transmission line to receive the strongest signal at a given setting\n",
      "on the volume control of the receiver. This is the best method of tuning\n",
      "an antenna when transmission is dangerous or forbidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) In some radio sets, the sniper uses the transmitter to adjust\n",
      "the antenna. First, he sets the controls of the transmitter to normal; then,\n",
      "he tunes the system by adjusting the antenna height, the antenna length,\n",
      "and the transmission line length to obtain the best transmission output.\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) Antenna cables must be handled carefully since they become\n",
      "\n",
      "brittle  in  low  temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Whenever possible, antenna cables should be constructed\n",
      "overhead to prevent damage from heavy snow and frost. Nylon rope\n",
      "guidelines, if available, should be used in preference to cotton or hemp\n",
      "because nylon ropes do not readily absorb moisture and are less likely to\n",
      "freeze and break.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) An antenna should have extra guidelines, supports, and anchor\n",
      "\n",
      "stakes to strengthen it to withstand heavy ice and wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Some radios (usually older generation radios) adjusted to a\n",
      "specific frequency in a relatively warm place may drift off frequency when\n",
      "exposed to extreme cold. Low battery voltage can also cause frequency drift.\n",
      "When possible, a radio should warmup several minutes before placing it\n",
      "into operation. Since extreme cold tends to lower output voltage of a dry\n",
      "battery, warming the battery with body heat before operating the radio set\n",
      "can reduce frequency drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Flakes or pellets of highly electrically charged snow is sometimes\n",
      "experienced in northern regions. When these particles strike the\n",
      "antenna, the resulting electrical discharge causes a high-pitched static\n",
      "roar that can blanket all frequencies. To overcome this static, antenna\n",
      "elements can be covered with polystyrene tape and shellac.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Maintenance Improvement in Arctic Areas. The maintenance of\n",
      "radio equipment in extreme cold presents many problems. Radio sets\n",
      "must be protected from blowing snow since snow will freeze to dials and\n",
      "knobs and blow into the wiring to cause shorts and grounds. Cords must\n",
      "be handled carefully as they may lose their flexibility in extreme cold.\n",
      "All radio equipment must be properly winterized. The appropriate\n",
      "technical manual should be checked for winterization procedures.\n",
      "Some suggestions for maintenance in Arctic areas include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Batteries. The effect of cold weather conditions on wet and dry\n",
      "cell batteries depends on the following factors: the type and kind of\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "FM 23-10\n",
      "\n",
      "battery, the load on the battery, the specific use of the battery, and the\n",
      "degree of exposure to cold temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Winterization. The radio set technical manual should rechecked for\n",
      "special precautions for operation in extremely cold climates. For example,\n",
      "normal lubricants may solidify and cause damage or malfunctions.\n",
      "They must be replaced with the recommended Arctic lubricants.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Microphone.  Moisture from the sniper’s breath may freeze on the\n",
      "perforated cover plate of his microphone. Standard microphone covers\n",
      "can be used to prevent this. If standard covers are not available, a suitable\n",
      "cover can be improvised from rubber or cellophane membranes or from\n",
      "rayon or nylon cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Breathing and sweating. A radio set generates heat when it\n",
      "is operated. When turned off, the air inside the radio set cools and\n",
      "contracts, and draws cold air into the set from the outside. This is\n",
      "called breathing. When a radio breathes and the still-hot parts come in\n",
      "contact with subzero air, the glass, plastic, and ceramic parts of the set may\n",
      "cool too rapidly and break. When cold equipment is brought suddenly\n",
      "into contact with warm air, moisture condenses on the equipment parts.\n",
      "This is called sweating. Before cold equipment is brought into a heated\n",
      "area, it should be wrapped in a blanket or parka to ensure that it warms\n",
      "gradually to reduce sweating. Equipment must be thoroughly dry before\n",
      "it is taken into the cold air or the moisture will freeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "7-9. JUNGLE AREAS\n",

      "The mobility and various configurations in which a single-channel radio\n",
      "can be deployed are its main advantages in jungle areas. Limitations on\n",
      "radio communications in jungle areas are due to the climate and the\n",
      "density of jungle growth. The hot and humid climate increases\n",
      "maintenance problems of keeping the equipment operable. Thick jungle\n",
      "growth acts as a vertically polarized absorbing screen for radio frequency\n",
      "energy that, in effect, reduces transmission range. Therefore, increased\n",

      "the jungle:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Locate antennas in clearings on the edge farthest from the distant\n",
      "\n",
      "station and as high as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Keep antenna cables and connectors off the ground to lessen the\n",
      "effects of moisture, fungus, and insects. This also applies to all power and\n",
      "telephone cables.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Use complete antenna systems, such as ground planes and\n",
      "\n",
      "dipoles, for more effect than fractional wavelength whip antennas.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Clear vegetation from antenna sites. If an antenna touches any\n",
      "\n",
      "foliage, especially wet foliage, the signal will be grounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) When wet, vegetation acts like a vertically polarized screen and\n",
      "absorbs much of a vertically polarized signal. Use horizontally polarized\n",
      "antennas in preference to vertically polarized antennas.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Maintenance Improvement in the Jungle. Due to moisture and\n",
      "fungus, the maintenance of radio sets in tropical climates is more difficult\n",
      "than intemperate climates The high relative humidity causes condensation\n",
      "to form on the equipment and encourages the growth of fungus.\n",
      "Operators and maintenance personnel should check appropriate technical\n",
      "manuals for special maintenance requirements. Some techniques for\n",
      "improving maintenance in jungle areas follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Keep the equipment as dry as possible and in lighted areas to\n",
      "\n",
      "retard fungus growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "dry the equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "growth as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Clear all air vents of obstructions so air can circulate to cool and\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Keep connectors, cables, and bare metal parts as free of fungus\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Use moisture and fungus-proofing paint to protect equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "after repairs are made or when equipment is damaged or scratched.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Expedient Antennas.  Sniper teams can improve their ability to\n",
      "communicate in the jungle by using expedient antennas. While moving, the\n",

      "Radio is usually the primary means of communications in the desert. It can\n",
      "be employed effectively in desert climate and terrain to provide a highly\n",
      "mobile means of communications demanded by widely dispersed forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Techniques for Better Operations. For the best operation in the\n",
      "desert, radio antennas should be located on the highest terrain available.\n",
      "In the desert, transmitters using whip antennas lose one-fifth to one-third\n",
      "of their normal range due to the poor electrical grounding common to desert\n",
      "terrain. For this reason, complete antenna systems must be used such as\n",
      "horizontal dipoles and vertical antennas with adequate counterpoises.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Equipment Considerations.  Some radios automatically switch on\n",
      "their second blower fan if their internal temperature rises too high.\n",
      "Normally, this happens only in temperate climates when the radios\n",
      "are transmitting. This may disturb soldiers unaccustomed to radio\n",
      "operation in the desert environment. Operation of the second fan,\n",
      "however, is quite normal. Radio frequency power amplifiers used in AM\n",
      "and single sideband sets may overheat and burn out. Such equipment\n",
      "should be turned on only when necessary (signal reception is not affected).\n",
      "Since the RF power amplifiers take about 90 seconds to reach the\n",
      "operating mode, the SOP of units using the equipment allows for delays\n",
      "in  replying.  Dust  affects  communications  equipment  such  as  SSB/AMRF\n",

      "FM 23-10\n",
      "\n",
      "power  amplifiers  and  radio  teletypewriter  sets.  Radio  teletypewriter  sets\n",
      "are prone to damage due to the vulnerability of the oil lubrication system,\n",
      "which attracts and holds dust particles. Dust covers, therefore, should be\n",
      "used when possible. Some receiver-transmitter units have ventilating\n",
      "ports and channels that can get clogged with dust. These must be checked\n",
      "regularly and kept clean to prevent overheating.\n",
      "\n",

      "d. Electrical Insulation. Wind-blown sand and grit damage\n",
      "electrical wire insulation over time. All cables that are likely to be\n",
      "damaged should be protected with tape before insulation becomes worn.\n",
      "Sand also finds its way into parts of items, such as “spaghetti cord” plugs,\n",
      "either preventing electrical contact or making it impossible to join the\n",
      "plugs together. A brush, such as an old toothbrush, should be carried and\n",
      "used to clean such items before they are joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "e. Condensation. In deserts with relatively high dew levels and high\n",
      "humidity, overnight condensation can occur wherever surfaces are cooler\n",
      "than the air temperature, such as metals exposed to air. This condensation\n",
      "can affect electrical plugs, jacks, and connectors. All connectors likely to\n",
      "be affected by condensation should be taped to prevent moisture from\n",
      "contaminating the contacts. Plugs should be dried before inserting them\n",
      "into equipment jacks. Excessive moisture or dew should be dried from\n",
      "antenna connectors to prevent arcing.\n",
      "\n",
      "f. Static Electricity. Static electricity is prevalent in the desert. It is\n",
      "caused by many factors, one of which is wind-blown dust particles.\n",
      "Extremely low humidity contributes to static discharges between charged\n",
      "particles. Poor grounding conditions aggravate the problem. All sharp\n",
      "edges (tips) of antennas should be taped to reduce wind-caused static\n",
      "discharges and the accompanying noise. If operating from a fixed\n",
      "position, teams ensure that equipment is properly grounded.\n",
      "Since static-caused noise lessens with an increase infrequency, the highest\n",
      "frequencies that are available and authorized should be used.\n",

      "g. Maintenance Improvement. In desert areas, the maintenance of\n",
      "radio sets becomes more difficult due to the large amounts of sand, dust, or\n",

      "\n",
      "a. Very high frequency radios are not as effective in urbanized terrain\n",

      "\n",
      "b. High frequency radios do not require or rely on line of sight as\n",
      "much as VHF radios. This is due to operating frequencies being lower\n",
      "and power output being greater. The problem is that HF radio sets are\n",
      "not organic to small units. To overcome this, the VHF signals must\n",
      "be retransmitted.\n",

      "c. Retransmission stations in aerial platforms can provide the most\n",
      "effective means if available. Organic retransmission is more likely to\n",

      "wire is added that is nearly the same length as the missing part of the whip.\n",
      "The pole support is then lashed securely to both sections of the antenna.\n",
      "The two antenna sections are cleaned thoroughly to ensure good contact\n",
      "before connecting them to the pole support. If possible, the connections\n",
      "are  soldered.\n",

      "b. Wire Antennas. Emergency repair of a wire antenna may involve\n",

      "line; or the repair or replacement of the assembly used to support\n",
      "the antenna.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) When one or more wires of an antenna are broken, the antenna\n",
      "can be repaired by reconnecting the broken wires. To do this, lower the\n",
      "antenna to the ground, clean the ends of the wires, and twist the\n",
      "wires together. Whenever possible, solder the connection.\n",

      "\n",
      "antenna should be the same length as the antenna it replaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Antennas supported by trees can usually survive heavy wind\n",
      "storms if the trunk of a tree or a strong branch is used as a support.\n",
      "To keep the antenna taut and to prevent it from breaking or stretching as\n",
      "the trees sway, the sniper attaches a spring or old inner tube to one end\n",
      "of the antenna. Another technique is to pass a rope through a pulley\n",
      "or eyehook. The rope is attached to the end of the antenna and loaded\n",
      "with a heavyweight to keep the antenna tightly drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Guidelines used to hold antenna supports are made of rope\n",
      "or wire. To ensure the guidelines will not affect the operation of the\n",
      "antenna, the sniper cuts the wire into several short lengths and connects\n",
      "the pieces with insulators.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Adjustment. An improvised antenna may change the performance\n",
      "of a radio set. The following methods can be used to determine if the\n",
      "antenna is operating properly\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) A distant station may be used to test the antenna. If the signal\n",
      "received from this station is strong, the antenna is operating satisfactorily.\n",
      "If the signal is weak, the sniper adjusts the height and length of the antenna\n",
      "and the transmission line to receive the strongest signal at a given setting\n",
      "on the volume control of the receiver. This is the best method of tuning\n",
      "an antenna when transmission is dangerous or forbidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) In some radio sets, the sniper uses the transmitter to adjust\n",
      "the antenna. First, he sets the controls of the transmitter to normal; then,\n",
      "he tunes the system by adjusting the antenna height, the antenna length,\n",
      "and the transmission line length to obtain the best transmission output.\n",
      "7-3. FIELD-EXPEDIENT OMNIDIRECTIONAL ANTENNAS\n",
      "Vertical antennas are omnidirectional. The omnidirectional antenna\n",
      "transmits and receives equally well in all directions. Most tactical\n",
      "antennas are vertical; for example, the man-pack portable radio uses a\n",
      "vertical whip and so do the vehicular radios in tactical vehicles. A vertical\n",
      "antenna can be made by using a metal pipe or rod of the correct length,\n",
      "held erect by means of guidelines. The lower end of the antenna should\n",
      "be insulated from the ground by placing it on a large block of wood or\n",
      "other insulating material. A vertical antenna may also be a wire\n",
      "supported by a tree or a wooden pole (Figure 7-3). For short vertical\n",
      "antennas, the pole may be used without guidelines (if properly supported\n",
      "at the base). If the length of the vertical mast is not long enough to\n",
      "support the wire upright, it may be necessary to modify the connection at\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) Antenna cables must be handled carefully since they become\n",
      "\n",
      "brittle  in  low  temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Whenever possible, antenna cables should be constructed\n",
      "overhead to prevent damage from heavy snow and frost. Nylon rope\n",
      "guidelines, if available, should be used in preference to cotton or hemp\n",
      "because nylon ropes do not readily absorb moisture and are less likely to\n",
      "freeze and break.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) An antenna should have extra guidelines, supports, and anchor\n",
      "\n",
      "stakes to strengthen it to withstand heavy ice and wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Some radios (usually older generation radios) adjusted to a\n",
      "specific frequency in a relatively warm place may drift off frequency when\n",
      "exposed to extreme cold. Low battery voltage can also cause frequency drift.\n",
      "When possible, a radio should warmup several minutes before placing it\n",
      "into operation. Since extreme cold tends to lower output voltage of a dry\n",
      "battery, warming the battery with body heat before operating the radio set\n",
      "can reduce frequency drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Flakes or pellets of highly electrically charged snow is sometimes\n",
      "experienced in northern regions. When these particles strike the\n",
      "antenna, the resulting electrical discharge causes a high-pitched static\n",
      "roar that can blanket all frequencies. To overcome this static, antenna\n",
      "elements can be covered with polystyrene tape and shellac.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Maintenance Improvement in Arctic Areas. The maintenance of\n",
      "radio equipment in extreme cold presents many problems. Radio sets\n",
      "must be protected from blowing snow since snow will freeze to dials and\n",
      "knobs and blow into the wiring to cause shorts and grounds. Cords must\n",
      "be handled carefully as they may lose their flexibility in extreme cold.\n",
      "All radio equipment must be properly winterized. The appropriate\n",
      "technical manual should be checked for winterization procedures.\n",
      "Some suggestions for maintenance in Arctic areas include:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Batteries. The effect of cold weather conditions on wet and dry\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "FM 23-10\n",

      "battery, the load on the battery, the specific use of the battery, and the\n",
      "degree of exposure to cold temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Winterization. The radio set technical manual should rechecked for\n",
      "special precautions for operation in extremely cold climates. For example,\n",
      "normal lubricants may solidify and cause damage or malfunctions.\n",
      "They must be replaced with the recommended Arctic lubricants.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Microphone.  Moisture from the sniper’s breath may freeze on the\n",
      "perforated cover plate of his microphone. Standard microphone covers\n",
      "can be used to prevent this. If standard covers are not available, a suitable\n",
      "cover can be improvised from rubber or cellophane membranes or from\n",
      "rayon or nylon cloth.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Breathing and sweating. A radio set generates heat when it\n",
      "is operated. When turned off, the air inside the radio set cools and\n",
      "contracts, and draws cold air into the set from the outside. This is\n",
      "called breathing. When a radio breathes and the still-hot parts come in\n",
      "contact with subzero air, the glass, plastic, and ceramic parts of the set may\n",
      "cool too rapidly and break. When cold equipment is brought suddenly\n",
      "into contact with warm air, moisture condenses on the equipment parts.\n",
      "This is called sweating. Before cold equipment is brought into a heated\n",
      "area, it should be wrapped in a blanket or parka to ensure that it warms\n",
      "gradually to reduce sweating. Equipment must be thoroughly dry before\n",
      "it is taken into the cold air or the moisture will freeze.\n",
      "\n",

      "The mobility and various configurations in which a single-channel radio\n",
      "can be deployed are its main advantages in jungle areas. Limitations on\n",
      "radio communications in jungle areas are due to the climate and the\n",
      "density of jungle growth. The hot and humid climate increases\n",
      "maintenance problems of keeping the equipment operable. Thick jungle\n",
      "growth acts as a vertically polarized absorbing screen for radio frequency\n",
      "energy that, in effect, reduces transmission range. Therefore, increased\n",

      "the jungle:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Locate antennas in clearings on the edge farthest from the distant\n",
      "\n",
      "station and as high as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Keep antenna cables and connectors off the ground to lessen the\n",
      "effects of moisture, fungus, and insects. This also applies to all power and\n",
      "telephone cables.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Use complete antenna systems, such as ground planes and\n",
      "\n",
      "dipoles, for more effect than fractional wavelength whip antennas.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Clear vegetation from antenna sites. If an antenna touches any\n",
      "\n",
      "foliage, especially wet foliage, the signal will be grounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) When wet, vegetation acts like a vertically polarized screen and\n",
      "absorbs much of a vertically polarized signal. Use horizontally polarized\n",
      "antennas in preference to vertically polarized antennas.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Maintenance Improvement in the Jungle. Due to moisture and\n",
      "fungus, the maintenance of radio sets in tropical climates is more difficult\n",
      "than intemperate climates The high relative humidity causes condensation\n",
      "to form on the equipment and encourages the growth of fungus.\n",
      "Operators and maintenance personnel should check appropriate technical\n",
      "manuals for special maintenance requirements. Some techniques for\n",
      "improving maintenance in jungle areas follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) Keep the equipment as dry as possible and in lighted areas to\n",
      "\n",
      "retard fungus growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "dry the equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "growth as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Clear all air vents of obstructions so air can circulate to cool and\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Keep connectors, cables, and bare metal parts as free of fungus\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) Use moisture and fungus-proofing paint to protect equipment\n",
      "\n",
      "after repairs are made or when equipment is damaged or scratched.\n",

      "c. Expedient Antennas.  Sniper teams can improve their ability to\n",

      "(B, Figure 7-13) the same length. Place the ends of the sticks together to\n",
      "form a triangle and tie the ends with wire, tape, or rope. Attach an\n",

      "Bring the other ends of the ground-plane wires together, attach them to\n",
      "an insulator (C, Figure 7-13, page 7-18), and tie securely. Strip about\n",

      "Strip about 3 inches of insulation from the radiating element at\n",
      "insulator C.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Cut enough WD-1 field wire to reach from the proposed location\n",
      "of the antenna to the radio set. Keep this line as short as possible, because\n",
      "excess length reduces the efficiency of the system. Tie a knot at each end\n",

      "7-10. DESERT AREAS\n",
      "Radio is usually the primary means of communications in the desert. It can\n",
      "be employed effectively in desert climate and terrain to provide a highly\n",
      "mobile means of communications demanded by widely dispersed forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Techniques for Better Operations. For the best operation in the\n",
      "desert, radio antennas should be located on the highest terrain available.\n",
      "In the desert, transmitters using whip antennas lose one-fifth to one-third\n",
      "of their normal range due to the poor electrical grounding common to desert\n",
      "terrain. For this reason, complete antenna systems must be used such as\n",
      "horizontal dipoles and vertical antennas with adequate counterpoises.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Equipment Considerations.  Some radios automatically switch on\n",
      "their second blower fan if their internal temperature rises too high.\n",
      "Normally, this happens only in temperate climates when the radios\n",
      "are transmitting. This may disturb soldiers unaccustomed to radio\n",
      "operation in the desert environment. Operation of the second fan,\n",
      "however, is quite normal. Radio frequency power amplifiers used in AM\n",
      "and single sideband sets may overheat and burn out. Such equipment\n",
      "should be turned on only when necessary (signal reception is not affected).\n",
      "Since the RF power amplifiers take about 90 seconds to reach the\n",
      "operating mode, the SOP of units using the equipment allows for delays\n",
      "in  replying.  Dust  affects  communications  equipment  such  as  SSB/AMRF\n",

      "\n",
      "power  amplifiers  and  radio  teletypewriter  sets.  Radio  teletypewriter  sets\n",
      "are prone to damage due to the vulnerability of the oil lubrication system,\n",
      "which attracts and holds dust particles. Dust covers, therefore, should be\n",
      "used when possible. Some receiver-transmitter units have ventilating\n",
      "ports and channels that can get clogged with dust. These must be checked\n",
      "regularly and kept clean to prevent overheating.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "weather causes batteries to fail more rapidly.\n",

      "d. Electrical Insulation. Wind-blown sand and grit damage\n",
      "electrical wire insulation over time. All cables that are likely to be\n",
      "damaged should be protected with tape before insulation becomes worn.\n",
      "Sand also finds its way into parts of items, such as “spaghetti cord” plugs,\n",
      "either preventing electrical contact or making it impossible to join the\n",
      "plugs together. A brush, such as an old toothbrush, should be carried and\n",
      "used to clean such items before they are joined.\n",
      "\n",
      "e. Condensation. In deserts with relatively high dew levels and high\n",
      "humidity, overnight condensation can occur wherever surfaces are cooler\n",
      "than the air temperature, such as metals exposed to air. This condensation\n",
      "can affect electrical plugs, jacks, and connectors. All connectors likely to\n",
      "be affected by condensation should be taped to prevent moisture from\n",
      "contaminating the contacts. Plugs should be dried before inserting them\n",
      "into equipment jacks. Excessive moisture or dew should be dried from\n",
      "antenna connectors to prevent arcing.\n",
      "\n",
      "f. Static Electricity. Static electricity is prevalent in the desert. It is\n",
      "caused by many factors, one of which is wind-blown dust particles.\n",
      "Extremely low humidity contributes to static discharges between charged\n",
      "particles. Poor grounding conditions aggravate the problem. All sharp\n",
      "edges (tips) of antennas should be taped to reduce wind-caused static\n",
      "discharges and the accompanying noise. If operating from a fixed\n",
      "position, teams ensure that equipment is properly grounded.\n",
      "Since static-caused noise lessens with an increase infrequency, the highest\n",
      "frequencies that are available and authorized should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "g. Maintenance Improvement. In desert areas, the maintenance of\n",
      "radio sets becomes more difficult due to the large amounts of sand, dust, or\n",

      "especially affected. To reduce maintenance downtime, the team must keep\n",

      "be kept clean to allow cool air to circulate to prevent overheating. Preventive\n",
      "maintenance checks should be made often. Also, the team should closely\n",

      "line interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Very high frequency radios are not as effective in urbanized terrain\n",
      "as they are in other areas. The power output and operating frequencies\n",

      "street level is not always possible in built-up areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. High frequency radios do not require or rely on line of sight as\n",
      "much as VHF radios. This is due to operating frequencies being lower\n",
      "and power output being greater. The problem is that HF radio sets are\n",
      "not organic to small units. To overcome this, the VHF signals must\n",
      "be retransmitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Retransmission stations in aerial platforms can provide the most\n",
      "effective means if available. Organic retransmission is more likely to\n",
      "be used. The antenna should be hidden or blended in with surroundings.\n",
      "This helps prevent the enemy from using it as a landmark to “home in”\n",

      "AN  EXPLOSION  occurs  when  energy  previously  confined  is  suddenly\n",
      "released to affect the surroundings. Small explosions,  like the bursting of a\n",
      "toy balloon,  are familiar and innocuous, but large-scale explosions,  like an\n",
      "atomic bomb, are rare and usually disastrous. Between these two extremes\n",
      "lie  the  commercial  and conventional  military fields where explosions  are\n",
      "produced on a limited scale to cause specific effects. It is with explosions  of\n",
      "this intermediate scale that this book is  concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unfortunately true to say that the views which most people hold on\n",
      "explosives  stem  either  from  first-hand  experience  of  the  effects  of\n",
      "explosives  used during times of war, or from reports of these effects. For\n",
      "military  purposes  explosives  are required to  cause  destruction  and are\n",
      "used  in  quantities  so  large  or  in  such  a  fashion  that  destruction  is\n",
      "inevitable.  As  a result, the impression  is given of  an overwhelming  force\n",
      "causing uncontrolled devastation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, in truth, explosives  can be used  as a controlled  and rather precise\n",
      "means of applying energy to a particular system.  Many tons of explosive\n",
      "may be used in a single blast at a quarry face, yet the only visible effect will\n",
      "be  for  the  face  of  that quarry to  slump to  the  ground.  It would  be bad\n",
      "practice indeed if rocks from that quarry face were thrown any  distance\n",
      "across  the floor of the quarry or the neighbouring countryside. When an\n",
      "explosive is fired on the surface of a piece of steel, it will harden that steel to\n",
      "a  predetermined depth  without  either  breaking the  steel  or  causing  any\n",
      "noticeable  deformation.  The  design  and  application  of  explosives  is  a\n",
      "science  and explosives  are as capable of control  as are other products of\n",
      "industry.\n",
      "\n",

      "substance  or  mixture  of  substances  which  is  in  itself  capable  (1)  of\n",
      "producing  a quantity of gas  under high pressure and (2) of being able to\n",

      "\n",
      "The burning of oil in a lamp is a slow process, the rate being determined\n",
      "by  the  need  for the oil  to  evaporate  and for the vapour  to  mix  with the\n",
      "surrounding  air to  form a combustible  mixture. To  speed  up the rate of\n",
      "combustion,  it is necessary  to  disperse  the oil in air before  ignition. In a\n",
      "motor car, petrol in the carburettor is mixed with the right amount of air so\n",
      "that  when ignited in the  cylinder it explodes.  Such gaseous mixtures are\n",
      "effective explosives but suffer from many disadvantages, of which the most\n",
      "important is the small amount of power available from any given volume.\n",
      "To obtain a better power ratio it is necessary to use solids or liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step in producing more rapid combustion  in a condensed phase\n",
      "is to provide a solid which will replace oxygen  from the air in  supporting\n",
      "combustion.  The use of nitrates for this purpose has a long history and it is\n",
      "probable that the stories of old Chinese explosives  and of Greek fire relate\n",
      "to  combustible mixtures to which nitrates had been  added  to make their\n",
      "reaction more intense. The first real record of an explosive, however, is the\n",
      "discovery of gunpowder, usually ascribed  to Roger Bacon.  Realising the\n",
      "possible  uses to which his discovery  could  be put, Bacon  concealed it in\n",
      "cypher,  and  gunpowder  was  rediscovered  in  Germany  by  Schwarz.\n",
      "Gunpowder, or blackpowder as it is now called, consists of a mixture of\n",
      "potassium nitrate, charcoal  and sulphur very intimately ground  together.\n",
      "It is readily ignited, even in complete  absence  of air, and then burns very\n",
      "rapidly. Moreover, if it is burned in a confined space, as in a borehole  or a\n",
      "military  shell,  then  as  the  pressure  increases  the  rate  of  burning  also\n",
      "increases to a high value. If a charge in a borehole is ignited at one end, the\n",
      "flame can propagate at a rate of several hundred metres a second.\n",

      "provided in a single chemical molecule. The discovery of nitroglycerine by\n",

      "readily turns into a form of reaction known as detonation. This process of\n",
      "detonation  of  nitroglycerine  can  best  be  regarded,  qualitatively, as  the\n",
      "passage  through  the  material  of  a  sudden  wave  of  high  pressure  and\n",
      "temperature  which  causes  the  molecules  to  break  down  into fragments\n",
      "which  later recombine  to  give the  ultimate explosion  products.  That the\n",
      "process  is more  vigorous  than combustion  is shown  by the high speed  of\n",
      "8000  m  s~J  at which it propagates; this speed is also independent  of the\n",

      "IN EARLY attempts to use nitroglycerine for blasting purposes, the practice\n",
      "was  to  ignite  the  nitroglycerine  with  blackpowder  charges.  Whilst this\n",
      "caused  combustion,  it  was  soon  found  to  be  unreliable  in  producing\n",
      "detonation.  Satisfactory results were first achieved by Nobel by the design\n",
      "of  the  detonator,  which  employed  fulminating  substances  as  ignition\n",
      "compounds. These materials, of a type now called initiating explosives, are\n",
      "characterised  by  the  fact  that  even  in small  quantities  they  detonate  on\n",
      "application of flame. Although initiating explosives  are sensitive, not only\n",
      "to  flame,  but also to  friction and percussion,  they  need be made only  in\n",
      "such  small  quantities  that  special  precautions  in  their handling  can  be\n",
      "taken. In the course of manufacture, the initiating explosives  are enclosed\n",
      "in metal tubes  and thereby so  protected  that the finished product  can  be\n",

      "It  is  always  necessary  for  the  shotfirer  to  be  at  a  distance  from  the\n",
      "explosive  when it is detonated. This can be achieved in either of two ways.\n",
      "The earlier method was to use safety fuse which was ignited at one end and\n",
      "burned  slowly  towards  the  detonator,  thus  giving  the  shotfirer  time  to\n",
      "retire to  safety.  The development  of  satisfactory  and reliable safety fuse\n",
      "was of considerable  importance  to the explosives  industry. But if a large\n",

      "the many ends of  safety  fuse and still retire to protection  before the first\n",
      "explosive detonated.  Therefore, a method was sought by which a number\n",
      "of lengths of safety fuse could  be ignited by a single operation.  This led to\n",
      "the  development  of  igniter cord,  which can  be joined  to  the ends  of the\n",

      "fuse  was  Cordeau,  which  was  made in the following manner.  TNT  was\n",
      "cast  into  a lead tube  and  allowed  to  solidify. The  whole  tube  was  then\n",
      "drawn down to a diameter of 4 mm. This drawing process at the same time\n",
      "broke down the cast TNT and brought it into a sensitive form which would\n",
      "propagate  whilst still confined by  the lead tube. Cordeau  had  a uniform\n",

      "possible.  From these  shafts, tunnels called stone  drifts are made,  roughly\n",
      "horizontally,  to the coal seams. The seams may be  1 m or more thick and\n",
      "are usually inclined at an angle to the horizontal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual work of getting coal is at a long straight face of 100 to 200 m\n",
      "in length. At each  end of this face  is a road which is used  for  conveying\n",
      "coal and materials and also for ventilation. The mining process consists of\n",
      "extracting the coal along the whole length of the face to give a regular daily\n",
      "advance.  The  first  stage  in  extraction  is  known  as  undercutting  and\n",
      "consists  of  cutting  a  10 or  12 cm  slot  to  a depth  of  about  1-5 m.  This\n",
      "creates  a free face to which the explosives  can work. Shotholes  are drilled\n",

      "positioned  between the cuts. Further, in many pits the thickness of the coal\n",

      "dogwood are best, but the cheaper  birch and beech  are frequently used for\n",

      "carbonised  to  the  correct  extent  and  this  depends  on  the  nature of  the\n",
      "wood.  In the case of alder, the optimum  carbon  content  is  74%,  whereas\n",

      "\n",
      "At  temperatures  below  30O0C,  the evolution  of hydrogen  sulphide is\n",

      "of  sulphur and nitric  oxide.  As  the  temperature is  raised,  however,  the\n",
      "evolution of nitrogen dioxide increases until there is excess which can react\n",
      "with sulphur to give sulphur dioxide and nitrogen. This sulphur dioxide can\n",

      "The  main  process  of  combustion  of  blackpowder  was  studied\n",
      "exhaustively  by  Nobel  and  Abel  and  by  Berthelot.  These  experimental\n",

      "1OKNO3 + 8C + 3S -*2K2CO3 + 3K2SO4 + 6CO2 + 5N2\n",
      "\n",
      "As the initial composition of blackpowder contains, for each  10 molecules\n",
      "of potassium nitrate, 14 molecules  of carbon and 4 molecules of sulphur,\n",
      "this equation does not account for 6 molecules of carbon and 1 molecule of\n",
      "sulphur.\n",

      "THE writer of  a book  on explosives is immediately  faced  with a  difficult\n",
      "task  of  selection.  He  must  decide  what  relative  importances  to  place  on\n",
      "military compared  with commercial  explosives,  and on theoretical  against\n",
      "practical aspects of the technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The  quantity  of  military  explosives  made  in  the  Second  World War\n",
      "exceeded the total ever made for peaceful  use by mankind. On this count it\n",
      "could  be argued that military explosives should occupy a major portion  of\n",
      "this  book.  On  the  other  hand,  wars  are fortunately  relatively  shorter  in\n",
      "duration  than peace, so that at any particular time a reader is likely to be\n",
      "interested more in commercial  explosives  than in military.\n",
      "\n",
      "More  important,  however,  is to consider  the contributions—good and\n",
      "bad—which  explosives  have  made  to  the history  of mankind. Any  real\n",
      "assessment  of  this  must  show  that  the  benefits  which  explosives  have\n",
      "produced  far outweigh  their  misuse  in  military pursuits.  The  explosives\n",
      "technologist,  who  has  usually  seen  and  perhaps  even  experienced  the\n",
      "effects  of explosives, is the last to want war or to want his products  to be\n",
      "used  for warlike purposes.  It is no accident  that Nobel, who founded the\n",
      "modern explosives  industry, also founded the Peace Prize associated with\n",
      "his name. In this book  the writer has followed his instincts and given pride\n",
      "of place to commercial,  beneficial applications of explosives.\n",

      "\n",
      "AN  EXPLOSION  occurs  when  energy  previously  confined  is  suddenly\n",
      "released to affect the surroundings. Small explosions,  like the bursting of a\n",
      "toy balloon,  are familiar and innocuous, but large-scale explosions,  like an\n",
      "atomic bomb, are rare and usually disastrous. Between these two extremes\n",
      "lie  the  commercial  and conventional  military fields where explosions  are\n",
      "produced on a limited scale to cause specific effects. It is with explosions  of\n",
      "this intermediate scale that this book is  concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unfortunately true to say that the views which most people hold on\n",
      "explosives  stem  either  from  first-hand  experience  of  the  effects  of\n",
      "explosives  used during times of war, or from reports of these effects. For\n",
      "military  purposes  explosives  are required to  cause  destruction  and are\n",
      "used  in  quantities  so  large  or  in  such  a  fashion  that  destruction  is\n",
      "inevitable.  As  a result, the impression  is given of  an overwhelming  force\n",
      "causing uncontrolled devastation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, in truth, explosives  can be used  as a controlled  and rather precise\n",
      "means of applying energy to a particular system.  Many tons of explosive\n",
      "may be used in a single blast at a quarry face, yet the only visible effect will\n",
      "be  for  the  face  of  that quarry to  slump to  the  ground.  It would  be bad\n",
      "practice indeed if rocks from that quarry face were thrown any  distance\n",
      "across  the floor of the quarry or the neighbouring countryside. When an\n",
      "explosive is fired on the surface of a piece of steel, it will harden that steel to\n",
      "a  predetermined depth  without  either  breaking the  steel  or  causing  any\n",
      "noticeable  deformation.  The  design  and  application  of  explosives  is  a\n",
      "science  and explosives  are as capable of control  as are other products of\n",
      "industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although all explosions  are sudden releases of energy, the converse is\n",
      "not true and not all sudden releases of energy are explosions. By  common\n",

      "consent,  the term explosive  is defined to exclude such  items as bottles  of\n",
      "compressed  gas,  even  though these  are capable of exploding  on rupture.\n",
      "For  the  purposes  of  this  book  an  explosive  will  be  taken  to  mean  a\n",
      "substance  or  mixture  of  substances  which  is  in  itself  capable  (1)  of\n",
      "producing  a quantity of gas  under high pressure and (2) of being able to\n",
      "produce this gas so rapidly under certain conditions (not necessarily those\n",
      "of practical use) that the surroundings are subjected to a strong dynamic\n",
      "stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burning of oil in a lamp is a slow process, the rate being determined\n",
      "by  the  need  for the oil  to  evaporate  and for the vapour  to  mix  with the\n",
      "surrounding  air to  form a combustible  mixture. To  speed  up the rate of\n",
      "combustion,  it is necessary  to  disperse  the oil in air before  ignition. In a\n",
      "motor car, petrol in the carburettor is mixed with the right amount of air so\n",
      "that  when ignited in the  cylinder it explodes.  Such gaseous mixtures are\n",
      "effective explosives but suffer from many disadvantages, of which the most\n",
      "important is the small amount of power available from any given volume.\n",
      "To obtain a better power ratio it is necessary to use solids or liquids.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step in producing more rapid combustion  in a condensed phase\n",
      "is to provide a solid which will replace oxygen  from the air in  supporting\n",
      "combustion.  The use of nitrates for this purpose has a long history and it is\n",
      "probable that the stories of old Chinese explosives  and of Greek fire relate\n",
      "to  combustible mixtures to which nitrates had been  added  to make their\n",
      "reaction more intense. The first real record of an explosive, however, is the\n",
      "discovery of gunpowder, usually ascribed  to Roger Bacon.  Realising the\n",
      "possible  uses to which his discovery  could  be put, Bacon  concealed it in\n",
      "cypher,  and  gunpowder  was  rediscovered  in  Germany  by  Schwarz.\n",
      "Gunpowder, or blackpowder as it is now called, consists of a mixture of\n",
      "potassium nitrate, charcoal  and sulphur very intimately ground  together.\n",
      "It is readily ignited, even in complete  absence  of air, and then burns very\n",
      "rapidly. Moreover, if it is burned in a confined space, as in a borehole  or a\n",
      "military  shell,  then  as  the  pressure  increases  the  rate  of  burning  also\n",
      "increases to a high value. If a charge in a borehole is ignited at one end, the\n",
      "flame can propagate at a rate of several hundred metres a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even  more  rapid  reaction  can  be  produced  if  oxygen  and  fuel  are\n",
      "provided in a single chemical molecule. The discovery of nitroglycerine by\n",
      "Sobrero  led  to  the  first  product  of  this  type  to  achieve  commercial\n",
      "importance.  Nitroglycerine  contains  enough  oxygen  to  burn all its own\n",

      "carbon  and  hydrogen.  It  is,  therefore,  capable  of  an  extremely  rapid\n",
      "combustion.  In practice, however, combustion  of this sort is unstable and\n",
      "readily turns into a form of reaction known as detonation. This process of\n",
      "detonation  of  nitroglycerine  can  best  be  regarded,  qualitatively, as  the\n",
      "passage  through  the  material  of  a  sudden  wave  of  high  pressure  and\n",
      "temperature  which  causes  the  molecules  to  break  down  into fragments\n",
      "which  later recombine  to  give the  ultimate explosion  products.  That the\n",
      "process  is more  vigorous  than combustion  is shown  by the high speed  of\n",
      "8000  m  s~J  at which it propagates; this speed is also independent  of the\n",
      "pressure of surrounding gas. Explosives  which detonate like nitroglycerine\n",
      "are known as high explosives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nitroglycerine  and  other  high  explosives  of  this  type  are  difficult  to\n",

      "THE  design  of  explosives  is  a  matter  of  major  importance  to  the\n",
      "manufacturer.  The  explosives  industries  of  the  world  are  extremely\n",
      "competitive  and  it  is  essential  that  products  should  be  as  cheap  as  is\n",
      "possible.  A range of products  must be provided such that one of them at\n",
      "least will be suitable for every type of work for which explosives  may be\n",
      "required. A typical range, apart from special sizes, would be about thirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explosives  contain  oxidising  and  combustible  ingredients,  whether\n",
      "united  in  a  single  molecule  or  present  in  different  chemicals.  A  proper\n",
      "balance is essential,  particularly if the explosive is to be used in confined\n",
      "places, especially  underground. The \"oxygen balance\" of an explosive is\n",
      "the  percentage  excess  of  oxygen  in  the  composition.  It  is  calculated,\n",
      "usually,  on  the  unwrapped  explosive,  as,  in practice,  only  a part of the\n",
      "wrapper (usually considered  to be about a ha!0 takes part in the chemical\n",
      "reaction.  Too  high  an oxygen  balance  leads to  the production  of nitric\n",
      "oxide  and  nitrogen  dioxide  in  the  explosion  fumes  which,  therefore,\n",
      "become  toxic.  Too  low  an oxygen  balance,  whilst having advantages in\n",
      "generally giving the explosive  a higher power, leads to the production of\n",
      "excessive  amounts  of  carbon  monoxide  which  is  also  poisonous.  The\n",

      "Complete  reaction  of  explosives  is  important  in  obtaining  the  best\n",

      "nitrate and oil and the proportion in which they are mixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted above (p. 36), the ammonium nitrate used for these  explosives\n",
      "should  be  porous  and  should  retain  7%  of  the  oil  without  tendency  to\n",
      "segregate on standing. A further requirement in modern practice is that the\n",
      "mixture,  when  blown  into  boreholes  by  compressed  air,  should  break\n",
      "down to give a proportion of fine powder which increases both the density\n",
      "of  loading  and the  sensitiveness  of  the mixture (see  p.  141).\n",
      "\n",
      "The oil used  should be of a volatile type, as the more volatile oils gives\n",
      "the greatest  sensitivity. However, the use of petroleum fractions with too\n",
      "low a flash point is hazardous.  The choice is, therefore, usually made of a\n",
      "fuel  oil similar to those used  for diesel engines.  It is common practice  to\n",
      "add a proportion  of dyestuff to the oil, partly to make adequate mixing of\n",
      "the explosive  immediately  visible, and partly to  assist  the user in  seeing\n",
      "proper loading of boreholes,  particularly in salt and other white materials.\n",
      "A  choice  of  composition  is  generally  determined by the necessity  for\n",
      "oxygen  balance.  A  range of 5-5-6% of fuel  oil gives a balanced mixture\n",
      "which  produces  negligible  poisonous  fume  and  maximum  power  on\n",
      "detonation.  For  certain  uses,  as in quarries, lower proportions  of oil are\n",

      "As  nitroglycerine  itself  is  nearly  oxygen  balanced,  the  mixture  of\n",

      "the  explosive  properties  required.  In  general,  the  aim  is  to  obtain  the\n",
      "highest  strength  per  unit  volume  and  this  is  achieved  by  attaining  the\n",
      "maximum density possible  in the explosive.  To this end, the ammonium\n",

      "IN EARLY attempts to use nitroglycerine for blasting purposes, the practice\n",
      "was  to  ignite  the  nitroglycerine  with  blackpowder  charges.  Whilst this\n",
      "caused  combustion,  it  was  soon  found  to  be  unreliable  in  producing\n",
      "detonation.  Satisfactory results were first achieved by Nobel by the design\n",
      "of  the  detonator,  which  employed  fulminating  substances  as  ignition\n",
      "compounds. These materials, of a type now called initiating explosives, are\n",
      "characterised  by  the  fact  that  even  in small  quantities  they  detonate  on\n",
      "application of flame. Although initiating explosives  are sensitive, not only\n",
      "to  flame,  but also to  friction and percussion,  they  need be made only  in\n",
      "such  small  quantities  that  special  precautions  in  their handling  can  be\n",
      "taken. In the course of manufacture, the initiating explosives  are enclosed\n",
      "in metal tubes  and thereby so  protected  that the finished product  can  be\n",
      "handled without danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "It  is  always  necessary  for  the  shotfirer  to  be  at  a  distance  from  the\n",
      "explosive  when it is detonated. This can be achieved in either of two ways.\n",
      "The earlier method was to use safety fuse which was ignited at one end and\n",
      "burned  slowly  towards  the  detonator,  thus  giving  the  shotfirer  time  to\n",
      "retire to  safety.  The development  of  satisfactory  and reliable safety fuse\n",
      "was of considerable  importance  to the explosives  industry. But if a large\n",
      "number of shots had to be fired, the operator might not have time to ignite\n",
      "the many ends of  safety  fuse and still retire to protection  before the first\n",
      "explosive detonated.  Therefore, a method was sought by which a number\n",
      "of lengths of safety fuse could  be ignited by a single operation.  This led to\n",
      "the  development  of  igniter cord,  which can  be joined  to  the ends  of the\n",
      "lengths of safety fuse by special connectors.  The shotfirer then only has to\n",

      "This manual has been prepared for police bomb technicians and concerned citizens as a\n",
      "recognition manual only ! Because of the possibility that this book may fall into the hands of\n",
      "those with criminal intent, I make this stern warning\n",
      "building a bomb is a major federal crime ! New antiterrorism laws have been enacted during\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "In order to educate and enlighten peace officers as to the construction and deployment\n",
      "possibilities of car bombs, I have compiled the material in this book .It has been written for\n",
      "one purpose :\n",
      "as an educational manual for those in the law enforcement community, especially police\n",
      "hazardous devices technicians (aka bomb technicians) .This book is not intended to educate\n",
      "criminals or provide them with the knowledge or inspiration to construct an actual explosive\n",
      "device .\n",
      "Actually, there is nothing in this book that criminals don’t already know .\n",
      "In order for me to write this book objectively, I wrote it strictly from an \"amoral\" point of\n",
      "view, in much the same way as the nineteenth century German philosophers wrote their great\n",
      "works .I chose not to take the side of good or bad or right or wrong.Through this view, pure\n",
      "creativity can be unleashed .\n",
      "This book resulted from my complete absorption with the late John Minnery’s \"Auto\n",
      "Suggestions\" in Kill Without joy : The Complete How To Kill Book .If you have not read\n",
      "that book, you are really missing something .It is available from Paladin Press .it is my wish\n",
      "that this book take up where the ingenious Mr.Minnery’s left off .\n",
      "Car bombs have been with us since the gangland slayings of the 1930s, and their use is\n",
      "growing even today .Yet the technology has come a long way since the days of the gangsters\n",
      "planting six sticks of dynamite under the hood of the rival gang’s car .An automobile has an\n",
      "electrical \"nervous\" system that can be tapped along many points .Only a basic knowledge of\n",
      "electronics is required to access it .\n",
      "Also, every automobile contains a bomb built right into it : the gasoline tank .\n",
      "The bomber only needs to do a bit of rewiring, drop the broken tail lamp, filament intact, into\n",
      "the gas tank, and, bingo, he has a bomb .When the victim turns on his lights, the filament\n",
      "flares up and ignites the gasoline vapors, which detonates the tank .\n",
      "Terrorists have made things even more troublesome for the police bomb technician by not\n",
      "using any wiring in their bombs .\n",
      "There is a glue that conducts electricity now on the market .The bomber need only affix the\n",
      "components to a board and run the glue to the components, thus creating the circuit .When\n",
      "the device is X-rayed, the bomb technician is unable to pick up the wiring layout .Many\n",
      "bomb techs don’t even know this glue exists .\n",
      "While we’re on the subject of new terrorist tricks, here are a couple more that are of extreme\n",
      "importance to the police bomb technician .Booby-trapped blasting caps are the latest in the\n",
      "international terrorist’s arsenal .Every bomb technician is advised to \"attack the cap\" when\n",
      "encountering a bomb .\n",
      "Attacking the blasting cap means to cut the wire leads on the cap, thus rendering it inert .\n",
      "Terrorists are now turning the tables on this technique by placing a hidden microswitch\n",
      "beneath or to the side of the blasting cap so that when the leads are cut and the cap is pulled\n",
      "out of the explosive device, the microswitch lever is released and the bomb explodes .\n",
      "The microswitch is connected to a separate hidden circuit (e.g., in a hollowed-out stick of\n",
      "dynamite, beneath the device in a hollowed-out base, etc.) .\n",
      "Another trick now favored by terrorists is the use of light-sensitive devices .The firing circuit\n",
      "incorporates a light-sensitive photocell .This closes the circuit when exposed to light .this\n",
      "type  of bomb is commonly found in a briefcase, box, or automobile trunk .\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Also of concern is the recent development of a product known as \"X-Ray Enhancer Sheet\"\n",
      "used by hospitals .When a sheet of this product is X- rayed, it glows .Thus when a bomber\n",
      "incorporates it in a light-sensitive bomb, the device cannot be X-rayed .If the police bomb\n",
      "technician X-rays the package to learn its contents, the enhancer sheet picks up the X-ray\n",
      "waves and the sheet glows .The light sensitive photocell receives the light, and the bomb\n",
      "explodes .\n",
      "Beware of the above two products .They could drastically change the way bomb technicians\n",
      "disarm suspected explosive devices .\n",
      "If you are a law enforcement officer, I hope you learn something new here .If you learn\n",
      "nothing else, just remember to keep your patrol car locked and your guard up on the home\n",
      "front .\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Detecting and Responding to a car bomb .\n",
      "The following procedures are recommended as a general outline that may be followed in the\n",
      "event of a suspected car bomb .Many techniques outlined here are of the author’s own\n",
      "invention .Note that the author is not a certified bomb technician and that the information\n",
      "given hereafter could potentially cause harm or death to those using the information.\n",
      "It is offered to certified police bomb technicians to provide possible new or improved options\n",
      "for dealing with car bombs .\n",
      "\"Prevention and awareness\" is the best advice for those who think they could be the target of\n",
      "a car bomber .in this business, there is no such thing as being too paranoid .Simply becoming\n",
      "aware can have a profound effect and possibly even deter an assassin and save your life .\n",
      "Always think from the criminal’s point of view .if you were the bomber, how and when\n",
      "would you hook up the bomb ? Turn things over and over in your mind :\n",
      "How would I do it ? Who are my enemies ? Where do I park my car ?\n",
      "A bomb technician once told me, \"Your worst enemy is almost always a friend\" .And the\n",
      "people closest to you know your habits .\n",
      "In the event a suspected car bomb is discovered, the hazardous devices technicians should be\n",
      "summoned at once.Normally, a uniformed officer arrives on the scene after the 911 call .He\n",
      "should not approach the targeted vehicle but should focus his efforts on evacuating the entire\n",
      "area .No one should be near doors or windows-if the device explodes, the shock wave could\n",
      "shatter glass for hundreds of yards, causing instant shrapnel .A rule of thumb is :  if you can\n",
      "see anyone, he is too close .\n",
      "The officer who arrives on the scene should close off the area in the safest possible manner,\n",
      "being careful not to get too elose to the suspected ear .He should summon additional\n",
      "manpower to close off all streets leading to the car .All police radio traffic must be done as\n",
      "far away as possible from the suspected ear, because electric blasting caps can be detonated\n",
      "by radio frequency alone (the leg wires act as antenna) .\n",
      "Keep in mind that the bomber may be watching the entire procedure from a nearby vantage\n",
      "point such as a rooftop .He may be waiting for officers to get close to the car before\n",
      "detonating the bomb via remote eontrol .\n",
      "Any burglar or car alarm can be used to fire a bomb simply by substituting the horn or beeper\n",
      "for the electrie blasting cap or improvised detonator .This is why I advise you not to approach\n",
      "the vehicle, since such an action could fire the bomb .\n",
      "Likewise, many devices could act as proximity sensors to fire a bomb .\n",
      "A metal detector pointing away from the metal car could keep officers at bay .Even if the\n",
      "bomb technician approached it in nothing but his shorts, the metal detector could be made\n",
      "sensitive enough to pick up the metal fillings in his teeth .I know this sounds far-fetched, but\n",
      "anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of basic electronics could conceivably construct it\n",
      "...and so much more .\n",
      "When the police bomb technicians arrive on the scene, they should best decide how to attack\n",
      "the suspected vehicle .The vehicle should be viewed through high-powered binoculars or,\n",
      "even better, a spotter’s scope or telescope .\n",
      "\n",

      "This manual has been prepared for police bomb technicians and concerned citizens as a\n",
      "recognition manual only ! Because of the possibility that this book may fall into the hands of\n",
      "those with criminal intent, I make this stern warning\n",
      "building a bomb is a major federal crime ! New antiterrorism laws have been enacted during\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "In order to educate and enlighten peace officers as to the construction and deployment\n",
      "possibilities of car bombs, I have compiled the material in this book .It has been written for\n",
      "one purpose :\n",
      "as an educational manual for those in the law enforcement community, especially police\n",
      "hazardous devices technicians (aka bomb technicians) .This book is not intended to educate\n",
      "criminals or provide them with the knowledge or inspiration to construct an actual explosive\n",
      "device .\n",
      "Actually, there is nothing in this book that criminals don’t already know .\n",
      "In order for me to write this book objectively, I wrote it strictly from an \"amoral\" point of\n",
      "view, in much the same way as the nineteenth century German philosophers wrote their great\n",
      "works .I chose not to take the side of good or bad or right or wrong.Through this view, pure\n",
      "creativity can be unleashed .\n",
      "This book resulted from my complete absorption with the late John Minnery’s \"Auto\n",
      "Suggestions\" in Kill Without joy : The Complete How To Kill Book .If you have not read\n",
      "that book, you are really missing something .It is available from Paladin Press .it is my wish\n",
      "that this book take up where the ingenious Mr.Minnery’s left off .\n",
      "Car bombs have been with us since the gangland slayings of the 1930s, and their use is\n",
      "growing even today .Yet the technology has come a long way since the days of the gangsters\n",
      "planting six sticks of dynamite under the hood of the rival gang’s car .An automobile has an\n",
      "electrical \"nervous\" system that can be tapped along many points .Only a basic knowledge of\n",
      "electronics is required to access it .\n",
      "Also, every automobile contains a bomb built right into it : the gasoline tank .\n",
      "The bomber only needs to do a bit of rewiring, drop the broken tail lamp, filament intact, into\n",
      "the gas tank, and, bingo, he has a bomb .When the victim turns on his lights, the filament\n",
      "flares up and ignites the gasoline vapors, which detonates the tank .\n",
      "Terrorists have made things even more troublesome for the police bomb technician by not\n",
      "using any wiring in their bombs .\n",
      "There is a glue that conducts electricity now on the market .The bomber need only affix the\n",
      "components to a board and run the glue to the components, thus creating the circuit .When\n",
      "the device is X-rayed, the bomb technician is unable to pick up the wiring layout .Many\n",
      "bomb techs don’t even know this glue exists .\n",
      "While we’re on the subject of new terrorist tricks, here are a couple more that are of extreme\n",
      "importance to the police bomb technician .Booby-trapped blasting caps are the latest in the\n",
      "international terrorist’s arsenal .Every bomb technician is advised to \"attack the cap\" when\n",
      "encountering a bomb .\n",
      "Attacking the blasting cap means to cut the wire leads on the cap, thus rendering it inert .\n",
      "Terrorists are now turning the tables on this technique by placing a hidden microswitch\n",
      "beneath or to the side of the blasting cap so that when the leads are cut and the cap is pulled\n",
      "out of the explosive device, the microswitch lever is released and the bomb explodes .\n",
      "The microswitch is connected to a separate hidden circuit (e.g., in a hollowed-out stick of\n",
      "dynamite, beneath the device in a hollowed-out base, etc.) .\n",
      "Another trick now favored by terrorists is the use of light-sensitive devices .The firing circuit\n",
      "incorporates a light-sensitive photocell .This closes the circuit when exposed to light .this\n",
      "type  of bomb is commonly found in a briefcase, box, or automobile trunk .\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Also of concern is the recent development of a product known as \"X-Ray Enhancer Sheet\"\n",
      "used by hospitals .When a sheet of this product is X- rayed, it glows .Thus when a bomber\n",
      "incorporates it in a light-sensitive bomb, the device cannot be X-rayed .If the police bomb\n",
      "technician X-rays the package to learn its contents, the enhancer sheet picks up the X-ray\n",
      "waves and the sheet glows .The light sensitive photocell receives the light, and the bomb\n",
      "explodes .\n",
      "Beware of the above two products .They could drastically change the way bomb technicians\n",
      "disarm suspected explosive devices .\n",
      "If you are a law enforcement officer, I hope you learn something new here .If you learn\n",
      "nothing else, just remember to keep your patrol car locked and your guard up on the home\n",
      "front .\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Detecting and Responding to a car bomb .\n",
      "The following procedures are recommended as a general outline that may be followed in the\n",
      "event of a suspected car bomb .Many techniques outlined here are of the author’s own\n",
      "invention .Note that the author is not a certified bomb technician and that the information\n",
      "given hereafter could potentially cause harm or death to those using the information.\n",
      "It is offered to certified police bomb technicians to provide possible new or improved options\n",
      "for dealing with car bombs .\n",
      "\"Prevention and awareness\" is the best advice for those who think they could be the target of\n",
      "a car bomber .in this business, there is no such thing as being too paranoid .Simply becoming\n",
      "aware can have a profound effect and possibly even deter an assassin and save your life .\n",
      "Always think from the criminal’s point of view .if you were the bomber, how and when\n",
      "would you hook up the bomb ? Turn things over and over in your mind :\n",
      "How would I do it ? Who are my enemies ? Where do I park my car ?\n",
      "A bomb technician once told me, \"Your worst enemy is almost always a friend\" .And the\n",
      "people closest to you know your habits .\n",
      "In the event a suspected car bomb is discovered, the hazardous devices technicians should be\n",
      "summoned at once.Normally, a uniformed officer arrives on the scene after the 911 call .He\n",
      "should not approach the targeted vehicle but should focus his efforts on evacuating the entire\n",
      "area .No one should be near doors or windows-if the device explodes, the shock wave could\n",
      "shatter glass for hundreds of yards, causing instant shrapnel .A rule of thumb is :  if you can\n",
      "see anyone, he is too close .\n",
      "The officer who arrives on the scene should close off the area in the safest possible manner,\n",
      "being careful not to get too elose to the suspected ear .He should summon additional\n",
      "manpower to close off all streets leading to the car .All police radio traffic must be done as\n",
      "far away as possible from the suspected ear, because electric blasting caps can be detonated\n",
      "by radio frequency alone (the leg wires act as antenna) .\n",
      "Keep in mind that the bomber may be watching the entire procedure from a nearby vantage\n",
      "point such as a rooftop .He may be waiting for officers to get close to the car before\n",
      "detonating the bomb via remote eontrol .\n",
      "Any burglar or car alarm can be used to fire a bomb simply by substituting the horn or beeper\n",
      "for the electrie blasting cap or improvised detonator .This is why I advise you not to approach\n",
      "the vehicle, since such an action could fire the bomb .\n",
      "Likewise, many devices could act as proximity sensors to fire a bomb .\n",
      "A metal detector pointing away from the metal car could keep officers at bay .Even if the\n",
      "bomb technician approached it in nothing but his shorts, the metal detector could be made\n",
      "sensitive enough to pick up the metal fillings in his teeth .I know this sounds far-fetched, but\n",
      "anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of basic electronics could conceivably construct it\n",
      "...and so much more .\n",
      "When the police bomb technicians arrive on the scene, they should best decide how to attack\n",
      "the suspected vehicle .The vehicle should be viewed through high-powered binoculars or,\n",
      "even better, a spotter’s scope or telescope .\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "The public should never be allowed to watch the bomb squad at work or learn the techniques\n",
